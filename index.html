        <h4>Earthquake</h4><br>
        <p>An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth,
            resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.
            Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough
            to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the
            frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word tremor is also used for
            non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
            At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground.
            When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to
            cause a tsunami.<a href="earthquakes.html">Click for more...</a>

        <h4>Volcano</h4><br>
        <p>
            A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava,
            volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. Earth's volcanoes occur because
            its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its
            mantle.Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or
            converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic
            Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes
            caused by convergent tectonic plates.<a href="#">Click for more...</a>

        <h4>Hurricanes</h4><br>
        <p>
            A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed
            low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce
            heavy rain. Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names,
            including hurricane, tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, and simply cyclone.A hurricane is
            a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs
            in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; while in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable storms are
            referred to simply as "tropical cyclones" or "severe cyclonic storms".<a href="#">Click for more...</a>

        <h4>Wildfire</h4><br>
        <p>
            A wildfire or wildland fire is a fire in an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in rural
            areas.Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more
            specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire,
            vegetation fire, and veld fire.
            Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million
            years ago.Wildfireâ€™s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire
            must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.Earth is an intrinsically
            flammable planet owing to its cover of carbon-rich vegetation, seasonally dry climates, atmospheric oxygen,
            and widespread lightning and volcanic ignitions.<a href="#">Click for more...</a>

        <h4>Tsunami</h4><br>
        <p>
            A tsunami or tidal wave, also known as a seismic sea wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by
            the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic
            eruptions and other underwater explosions (including detonations of underwater nuclear devices),
            landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water all have the
            potential to generate a tsunami.Unlike normal ocean waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are
            generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of
            water.<a href="#">Click for more...</a>

        <h4>Tornado</h4><br>
        <p>
            A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a
            cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. The windstorm is often referred to as a
            twister, whirlwind or cyclone,although the word cyclone is used in meteorology to name a weather system
            with a low-pressure area in the center around which winds blow counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere
            and clockwise in the Southern.Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the
            form of a condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating
            debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are
            about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.<a href="#">Click

        <h4>Thunderstorm and Lighting</h4><br>
        <p>
            A thunderstorm, also known as an electrical storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm
            characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as
            thunder.Thunderstorms occur in a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by
            strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all.
            Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe
            thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous weather phenomena, including large hail, strong winds, and
            tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones.<a
